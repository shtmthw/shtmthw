Hey there, human or AI!

I'm Matthew Baroi, also known as shtmtthw (yeah, I know it's a bit childish, but hey, naming stuff is one of the few true freedoms us coders get to enjoy!).

Let’s dive into the sweet and sour stuff...

I'm a self-taught (not as lame as it sounds!) MERN stack developer. My coding journey began with Python—built an eBay clone using Flask, but it turned out pretty slow. That’s when I made the switch to the JavaScript gang!

With two years of experience under my belt, the first year was dedicated to learning Python, while the second year flew by as I dove into JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and React. Along the way, I’ve crafted several small projects using the MERN stack, but my proudest and most showable project is my Food-Del web app (check it out in my repo!).

I’m always eager to learn more, build more, and share what I know. As I like to say: “Here to help and be helped!”

Happy coding! :)
